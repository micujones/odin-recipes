# odin-recipes

This is the first quasi-official project. It will start with incorporating HTML concepts that I have learned in the first few lessons of the Odin Project Foundations course.

## July 16

It turns out that this webpage would be a touchstone throughout the curriculum. I did not commit work from the previous set of css lessons. That would have been great to see a clearer progression. At this point, I am incorporating classes, ids, and selectors, as well as experimenting with the use of divs. It's dawned on me that my knowledge for manipulating divs is limited to vertical layouts. This commit will include cards for the homepage's menu, which I intend to make into a grid at some point. Right now, it is an unordered list.
